# Embedded Passwordless Authentication for SPAs

<%= include('../../../_includes/_embedded_login_warning') %>

## Using Auth0's SDKs to implement Embedded Login

You can implement Login using [Auth0's Lock widget](/libraries/lock/v11#passwordless), or if you need complete control of the user experience, you can implement it using [Auth0.js](/libraries/auth0js/v9#passwordless-login).

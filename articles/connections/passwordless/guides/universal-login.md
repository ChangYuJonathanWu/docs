[Universal Login](/universal-login) is Auth0's implementation of the login flow, which is the key feature of an Authorization Server. Each time a user needs to prove their identity, your applications redirect to Universal Login and Auth0 will do what is needed to guarantee the user's identity. By choosing Universal Login, you don't have to do any integration work to handle the various flavors of authentication. It's the preferred way to implement Passwordless Authentication.

To configure your Universal Login page to use Passwordless Authentication please refer to [Configure Universal Login with Passwordless](/dashboard/guides/universal-login/configure-login-page-passwordless).

To integrate Universal Login in your application, please refer to our [Quickstarts](/quickstarts), where you'll find complete examples for all application types and popular platforms.
